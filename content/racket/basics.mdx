### Comments
Single-line comments start with a semicolon:
<code>; This is a comment </code>

Multi-line comments are in between <code>#|</code> and <code>|#</code>
<code>
#| This is<br />
a<br />
multi-line<br />
comment |#
</code>


### Prefix syntax
Usually, when we write mathematical expressions, we use <b>infix</b> syntax.

For example, we might write 3 + 2, where the operator is between the numbers. 
This is just a human convention; we could also use postfix syntax such as writing 3 2 +

However, Racket uses a <b>prefix</b> syntax. The operator comes at the beginning in expressions.
To find 3 + 2, you would write <code>(+ 3 2)</code> in Racket. 
By using parenthesis, nesting becomes possible. If we wanted to find 3 + 5 * 2, 
for example, we could write <code>(+ 3 (\* 5 2))</code>. 
The (\* 5 2) would evaluate to 10, and the expression would become (+ 3 10)
which evaluates to 13.

### More data types
We introduced some basic arithmetic functions already like + and \*. Booleans (true or false values)
and Strings (text) also can have functions applied to them.

Booleans are written as <code>#t</code> for true and <code>#f</code> for false. 

Some functions on booleans:
<code>(not #t)</code> => <code>#f</code> <br />
<code>(or #t #f)</code> => <code>#t</code> <br />
<code>(and #t #f)</code> => <code>#f</code>

Strings are blocks of text. 
You can print them using using the <code>printf</code> function
<code>(printf "Hello Racket")</code> => "Hello Racket" 

### Variables
Variables allow you to assign a value to something which can be used again in your code.

You create a variable using the define keyword:
<code>(define x 3) ; assigns the number 3 to x</code><br />
<code>(* x 2)</code> => 6

### Functions
Functions take in an input and use them to produce an output.

You can create functions using the define keyword with the list of parameters going in parenthesis.

Example:
<code>(define (greeting name)<br />
&#9;(string-append "Greetings, " name))
</code><br /><br />

<code>(greeting "Bob")</code> => "Greetings, Bob"
