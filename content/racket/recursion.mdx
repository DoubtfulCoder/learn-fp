### Recursion basics
Recursion is a technique in which a function calls itself.

There are two parts to recursion:
1. A recursive call: calling the function again with a simpler input
2. The base case: the final case where you stop calling the function

A simple example is a factorial problem. A factorial of n multiples all the numbers from 1 to n. 
For example, 5! is 5\*4\*3\*2\*1

How would we write a recursive function to solve this?
1. Recursive call: we would want to multiply each number by the number below it, by the number below it, etc.
2. Base case: once we reach 1, we stop

Code:
<code>
(define (factorial n)   <br />
(if (= n 1)     <br />
    1   <br />
    (* n (factorial (- n 1))))  <br />
)
</code>

### Tail recursion
Tail recursion is a special type of recursion in which the value to return is tracked throughout the recursion.
